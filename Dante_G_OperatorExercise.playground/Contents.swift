// this example proves what the previous comment as true. also I do not need the label "BaseValue" but it organizes my thoughts.

var SubtractionResult = 0

SubtractionResult =  32 - 13
// this shows that the subtraction result will end up as any two numbers subtracted from one another.

MultiplicationResult = 8 * 3
// any two numbers multiplied by one another gives the result.

MultiplicationResult = 87 * 7
//confirmation to make sure the multiplication worked.

var DivisionResult = 0

DivisionResult = 30 / 5
//any two or more numbers will result into the soultion of the division result.

DivisionResult = 2000000 / 10
// conformation for the division calculation.
